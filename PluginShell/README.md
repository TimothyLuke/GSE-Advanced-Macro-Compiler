This folder contains the minumum for a Macro Plugin to GSE2.  

You can convert myMacros to this by performing the TOC changes and adding in the loaded.lua file.  If you plan to do all your edits outside of the game then you can use the GSE API (https://timothyluke.github.io/GnomeSequencer-Enhanced/docs/) and LUA to force your updates.
