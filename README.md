About this Repository
===================================
This repository is a work in progress.  Code here may be broken at any point in time.  This contains the source code for GnomeSequencer-Enahnced in its raw form.  Libraries are referred to but are not present in this repository.  While releases are tagged as releases, alpha builds are released via http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/gnomesequencer-enhanced/  

To use this locally straight from this source you must install https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/ace3 as a standalone mod.  You must also install all the libraries listed in the .pkgmeta in the lib folder and set an exclusion in your .git file.
